# HNG12 Public API

## Overview
This project is a simple public API built for the **HNG12 Internship Program**. It returns the following information in JSON format:
- Your registered email address (used to register on the HNG12 Slack workspace).
- The current datetime as an ISO 8601 formatted timestamp.
- The GitHub URL of the project's codebase.

The API is built using **Node.js** with **Express** and **CORS**, and it is deployed to a publicly accessible endpoint.

---

## Features
- **Public API Endpoint**: Accessible via a public URL.
- **JSON Response**: Returns data in a structured JSON format.
- **CORS Support**: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) appropriately.
- **Deployed on Render**: Hosted on a cloud platform for public access.

## API Endpoint
The API is accessible at the following endpoint:
```
https://hng12-api.onrender.com/api/info
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "email": "your-email@domain.com",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-05T12:34:56.789Z",
  "github_url": "https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo"
}
```
